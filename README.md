# LRT4102-Lab4-URDF_and_PlotJuggler
Fourth laboratory practice made for Design of Robotics Systems (LRT4102) in collaboration with Joan Carlos Monfil Huitle. The practice focused in the generation of a URDF model for a cartesian robot, thus, the usage and function of PlotJuggler as a tool for robotics, rosbag is also explored in a very basic way.
